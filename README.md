It is effiecient way to write cleaner code, It is done in the `server-config.js` folder.

- In this folder we also setup our database connection throgh `mongoose`
- firstly, install mongoose to execute the following command:

  ```
  npm install mongoose

  ```
- after that connect database before starting Application on

  PORT 3000

  ```
- Inside the `Models` folder we are creating our schema of User database, once schema is created based on that schema you can save documents to mongoDB based on that schema. MongoDB provides `save()` methode to save data with propder validation.

`models`-> in this file, we created the template of the database schema 


- `Middlewares` In this folder we are basically build user Authentication feather, whenever user try to loggin, it `JWT` token is created keep inside the `Cookies` in the server and send back to the Client-side. Now, whenever the user made API call, the cookies will be validated.
